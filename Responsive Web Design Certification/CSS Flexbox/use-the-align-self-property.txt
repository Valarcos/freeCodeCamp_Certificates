  /*The final property for flex items is align-self. This property allows you to adjust each item's alignment individually, instead of setting them all at once. This is useful since other common adjustment techniques using the CSS properties float, clear, and vertical-align do not work on flex items.

  align-self accepts the same values as align-items and will override any value set by the align-items property.
Does align-self override other flex properties as well? 
  I tried using justify-content:flex-start; to set the alignment for the box-container class, but the flex items where not affected while the align-self property was set.
  After including the rule for the container and removing the rule for a particular item I got proof that my previous guess was correct in that the particular rules override the general ones.*/
  #box-1 {
    background-color: dodgerblue;
    align-self: center;

  #box-2 {
    background-color: orangered;
    align-self: flex-end;
    height: 200px;
    width: 200px;
