<!--Subsections of an h tag section are made with h tags with a lower number than the one used for the section. The scaling should be progressive and not use a number difference larger than 1 to make a subsection(h2 has h3 subsections, h3 has h4 subsections; h2 having h4 or h5 subsections is wrong). If the objective is font size management, its better to use CSS styling. -->
