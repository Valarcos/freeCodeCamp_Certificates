/*The last challenge created an object with various properties. Now 
you'll see how to access the values of those properties. Here's an 
example:

let duck = {
  name: "Aflac",
  numLegs: 2
};
console.log(duck.name);
// This prints "Aflac" to the console
Dot notation is used on the object name, duck, followed by the name 
of the property, name, to access the value of "Aflac".*/
