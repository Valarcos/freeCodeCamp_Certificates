      USED when accesing or checking for a property using the 
      property name.
      
      The only instance in wich quotes are not used inside the 
      brackets is when a variable is used instead of a property 
      name (said variable may have inside it the variable name and
      thus it will work for this operation)*/

/*Sometimes you may need to iterate through all the keys within an 
object. This requires a specific syntax in JavaScript called a 
for...in statement. For our users object, this could look like:

for (let user in users) {
  console.log(user);
}

// logs:
Alan
Jeff
Sarah
Ryan

In this statement, we defined a variable user, and as you can see, 
this variable was reset during each iteration to each of the 
object's keys as the statement looped through the object, resulting 
in each user's name being printed to the console. 

NOTE: Objects do not maintain an ordering to stored keys like arrays 
do; thus a key's position on an object, or the relative order in 
which it appears, is irrelevant when referencing or accessing that 
key.*/
