/*Do NOT mistake slice for splice since both methods work in similar
but very different ways.

Slice copies a given number of elements from an array.
Splice modifies the array, be it by only eliminating elements within
it or adding elements at the same time as eliminating elements. */

/*The next method we will cover is slice(). slice(), rather than 
modifying an array, copies, or extracts, a given number of elements 
to a new array, leaving the array it is called upon untouched. slice
() takes only 2 parameters â€” the first is the index at which to 
begin extraction, and the second is the index at which to stop 
extraction (EXTRACTION WILL OCCUR UP TO, BUT NOT INCLUDING THE 
ELEMENT AT THIS INDEX). Consider this:

let weatherConditions = ['rain', 'snow', 'sleet', 'hail', 'clear'];

let todaysWeather = weatherConditions.slice(1, 3);
// todaysWeather equals ['snow', 'sleet'];
// weatherConditions still equals ['rain', 'snow', 'sleet', 'hail', 'clear']

In effect, we have created a new array by extracting elements from 
an existing array.*/
