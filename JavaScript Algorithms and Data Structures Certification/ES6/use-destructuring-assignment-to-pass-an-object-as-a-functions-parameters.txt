/*The object/array element manipulation techniques may be really useful, but as of now I'm a complete novice in this topic, so i constantly need to access the hint option and i find that unbearable. I WANT TO be able to do it without relying on looking at the answer with the problem solved by someone else. */

console.log(stats); // should be object
console.log(half(stats)); // should be 28.015

/*In some cases, you can destructure the object in a function argument itself.
Consider the code below:

const profileUpdate = (profileData) => {
  const { name, age, nationality, location } = profileData;
  // do something with these variables
}

This effectively destructures the object sent into the function. This can also be done in-place:

const profileUpdate = ({ name, age, nationality, location }) => {
  // do something with these fields 
  // do something with these fields 
}

This removes some extra lines and makes our code look neat. This has the added benefit of not having to manipulate an entire object in a function â€” only the fields that are needed are copied inside the function.*/
