const arr1 = ['JAN', 'FEB', 'MAR', 'APR', 'MAY'];

arr2= [...arr1];  /* If the idea is to assign the values from one 
array to the other, then the normal syntax for adding elements to an 
array should be used, and instead of simply writing arr1 inside the 
brackets, wich would lead to adding the arr1 as an element of the 
arr2 array (not what we want), using "..." before the name of the 
array will lead to every element of the arr1 array to be assigned as 
an individual element of the arr2 array.*/

/*...arr returns an unpacked array. In other words, it spreads the 
array. However, the spread operator only works in-place, like in an 
argument to a function or in an array literal. The following code 
will not work: 

const spreaded = ...arr; // will throw a syntax error*/
