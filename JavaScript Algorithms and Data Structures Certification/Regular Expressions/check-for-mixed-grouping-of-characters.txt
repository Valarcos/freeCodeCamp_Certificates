this requires way to much typing, using parentheshis for Eleanor and Franklin with an or(|) character in the middle works just the same but is simpler.*/

/*Sometimes we want to check for groups of characters using a 
Regular Expression and to achieve that we use parentheses ().
If you want to find either Penguin or Pumpkin in a string, you can 
use the following Regular Expression: /P(engu|umpk)in/g
Then check whether the desired string groups are in the test string 
by using the test() method.

let testStr = "Pumpkin";
let testRegex = /P(engu|umpk)in/g;
testRegex.test(testStr);
// Returns true*/
