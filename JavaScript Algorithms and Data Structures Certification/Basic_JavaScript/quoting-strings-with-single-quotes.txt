/*JavaScript does not discriminate between double quotes and single
quotes. They work the same way. But what must be taken into account
is that despite the fact that you can make a string using either
quote, you must end said string with the same type of quote used to
start it.
This peculiarity of quotes in JavaScript can be useful when i want
to make a string with several instances of quoted text. Instead of
using several escape characters (the backslash character), alternating between one type of quote for the outer quotes that 
start and end the string and the other type of quote for the quoted
text inside the string can make the easier the experience of writing
that string.*/
