// Setup
var myStr = "Jello World";

// Only change code below this line

myStr = "Hello World"; // Fix Me

/*In JavaScript, String values are immutable, which means that they cannot be altered once created. 
The only way to change the string inside a variable is to assign a
new string to the variable. Even if one can access specific 
characters inside a string using the index selector, said specific 
characters cannot be altered using this notation. 

var myStr = "Bob";
myStr[0] = "J";

The example above does not work.*/
