	    /*The use of the += operator makes it easier to modify
            a variable when the intention is to add a value to
            the previous value stored in the variable.
            
            As it happened when learning to program with C++, its 
            fairly possible that the order in wich the + and = 
            operators are combined (+= or =+) affects the way the
            variable is modified.
	    For some unknown reason, the freeCodeCamp tester didnt
	    ackowledge the submission of the challenge's solution
	    because there was a comment in the editor page. This 
	    should'nt happen since comments are supposed to be 
	    ignored.*/
