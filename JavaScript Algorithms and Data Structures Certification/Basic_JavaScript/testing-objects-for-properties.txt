// Setup
var myObj = {
  gift: "pony",
  pet: "kitten",
  bed: "sleigh"
};

function checkObj(checkProp) {
  // Your Code Here
  if(myObj.hasOwnProperty(checkProp)){
    return myObj[checkProp];
  }
  return "Not Found";  
}

// Test your code by modifying these values
console.log(checkObj("gift"));
console.log(checkObj("pet"));
console.log(checkObj("house"));

/*Sometimes it is useful to check if the property of a given object 
exists or not. We can use the .hasOwnProperty(propname) method of 
objects to determine if that object has the given property name. 
.hasOwnProperty() returns true or false if the property is found or 
not.

Example

var myObj = {
  top: "hat",
  bottom: "pants"
};
myObj.hasOwnProperty("top");    // true
myObj.hasOwnProperty("middle"); // false  

when "top" is checked to see if a property has that name, it goes in quotes because its a string. However, in the case of the challenge itself, what is used is the argument given to the function. This works just as a variable being used to access an object's property, so it must be invoked between brackets when trying to access the object's property.*/
