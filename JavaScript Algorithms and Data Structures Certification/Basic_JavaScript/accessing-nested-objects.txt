/*When there are several levels in a complex data structure, in this case 
an object, the sub-properties of objects can be accessed by chaining 
together the dot or bracket notation. 

Use dot notation for all properties where possible, otherwise use bracket 
notation. My guess is that this recommendation has to do with the tidyness
of the code.*/
