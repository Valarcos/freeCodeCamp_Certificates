var quotient = 4.4 / 2.0;   /*Fix this line
For some unknown reason, the freeCodeCamp's editor gave a 
strong color to the comment of "fix this line" when it was written
on the same line as the division operation and stablished using the
single line comment operator (//). Using the multiple line comment
operator seems to work just fine. It may be a particular interaction
that happens when said string of characters appear on the same line 
while using their editor*/
