/*Objects are declared just as variables are, using the 'var' 
keyword followed by a space before the name of the object is given. 
This objects in JavaScript have their data organized in properties. 
Their names are written between quotes (in other words, the names 
are strings).

Properties are separated by commas. The last property to be defined 
does not end with a comma, instead it simply is followed by the 
closing brace(llave) */
