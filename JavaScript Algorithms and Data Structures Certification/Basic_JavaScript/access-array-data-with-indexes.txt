// Example
var ourArray = [50,60,70];
var ourData = ourArray[0]; // equals 50

// Setup
var myArray = [50,60,70];

// Only change code below this line.

var myData = myArray[0];

/*Just as indexes can be used to access particular characters inside
a string variable, indexes can also be used to access specific 
variables stored within an array. The way this pieces of knowledge 
are piling up suggests the possibility of accessing a variable 
inside an array that is nested inside another array.

It may involve complicated operations or functions, but it may also 
just involve a simple line of code that needs to be properly written 
to avoid grave mistakes.

I'm wondering if the restriction of not being able to modify 
characters inside strings using the index is also applied to 
arrays.*/
