function checkSign(num) {
    return (num > 0)? "positive":(num < 0)? "negative": "zero"
}

/*It seems that when chaining multiple conditional operators, the
conditions need to be encased in parenthesis before the questionmark symbol*/

console.log(checkSign(10));

/*In the previous challenge, you used a single conditional 
operator. You can also chain them together to check for multiple 
conditions.

The following function uses if, else if, and else statements to 
check multiple conditions:

function findGreaterOrEqual(a, b) {
  if (a === b) {
    return "a and b are equal";
  }
  else if (a > b) {
    return "a is greater";
  }
  else {
    return "b is greater";
  }
}

The above function can be re-written using multiple conditional 
operators:

function findGreaterOrEqual(a, b) {
  return (a === b) ? "a and b are equal" 
    : (a > b) ? "a is greater" 
    : "b is greater";
}

However, this should be used with care as using multiple 
conditional operators without proper indentation may make your 
code hard to read. For example:

function findGreaterOrEqual(a, b) {
  return (a === b) ? "a and b are equal" : (a > b) ? "a is greater" : "b is greater";
}
