/*Sometimes you may want to store data in a flexible Data Structure. 
A JavaScript object is one way to handle flexible data. They allow 
for arbitrary combinations of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, 
functions, and objects.

Here's an example of a complex data structure:

var ourMusic = [
  {
    "artist": "Daft Punk",
    "title": "Homework",
    "release_year": 1997,
    "formats": [ 
      "CD", 
      "Cassette", 
      "LP"
    ],
    "gold": true
  }
];

This is an array which contains one object inside. The object has 
various pieces of metadata about an album. It also has a nested 
"formats" array. If you want to add more album records, you can do 
this by adding records to the top level array. Objects hold data in 
a property, which has a key-value format. In the example above, 
"artist": "Daft Punk" is a property that has a key of "artist" and a 
value of "Daft Punk". JavaScript Object Notation or JSON is a 
related data interchange format used to store data. */
