  /*for simple comparisons its sometimes better to avoid 
  using i.f statements to make the code less clunky and more 
  readable. 

  Also, there is a possible added benefit in not using an i.f 
  statement. When the use of an i.f statement is avoided, the code 
  runs faster because there are less comparisons that need 
  proccesing capacity to be done, efectively reducing the time it 
  takes for the whole code to be executed (this is easier to notice 
  when a block of code runs a loop with one or more i.f statements 
  inside it a ton of times, the insigni.ficant delays start to pile 
  up, eventually delaying the proccess by a noticeable ammount of 
  time). Using a return statement only may be cheaper in code 
  writing cost, but its completely unknown to me i.f its more 
  efficient than an i.f statement.*/
