/*There are several characters that can make use of the backlash escape character to be typed inside a string without JavaScript 
misinterpreting what the programmer's intention was.
The following is a list of several examples of what is written above

Code            Output
\'          single quote
\"          double quote
\\          backslash           
\n          newline
\r          carriage return
\t          tab
\b          word boundary
\f          form feed

Note that the backslash itself must be escaped in order to display as a backslash.*/
