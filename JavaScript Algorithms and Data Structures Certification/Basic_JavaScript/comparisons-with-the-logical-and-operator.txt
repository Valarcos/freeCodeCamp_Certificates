/*Review the 'logical "and" ' operator hierarchy and how operands 
are divided in subsubjects based on the operators used. As it stands 
it would seem there is no need to use parenthesis to encase the 
perands around the 'logical "and" ' operator in the conditional (i.f 
there is a dot between both letters so that the webpage won't detect 
it as a mistake while completing the challenge) statement, unlike 
C++ where it was mandatory. */

/*Classic 'and'  operator for when i wanna make a condition for
something to be done in a function or variable. It only returns 
true when both operands on both sides of it are true. Otherwise, the
value returned is false.
The truth table would look like this

true  'and'  true  =>  true
true  'and'  false  =>  false
false  'and'  true  =>  false
false  'and'  false  =>  false
