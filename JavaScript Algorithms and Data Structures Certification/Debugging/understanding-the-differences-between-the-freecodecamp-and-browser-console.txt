// Open your browser console.
let output = "Get this to log once in the browser console and twice in the freeCodeCamp console";
// Use console.clear() on the next line to clear the browser console.
console.clear();

// Use console.log() to print the output variable.
console.log(output);

/* Check the two consoles to see the difference. The freeCodeCamp console should have printed the 
variable twice, once for each test of this challenge. The browser console should only print the 
variable once because you cleared it first.*/

/*In the case where I see several instances of the output variable being logged in the browser console
and I think that i cant get the challenge to work as it tells me it should, remember something first:

CLEAR THE CONSOLE before checking for the ammount of times a certain variable has been logged*/
