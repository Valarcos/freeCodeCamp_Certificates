const JSX = (
  <div>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>Lets render this to the DOM</p>
  </div>
);
// change code below this line

ReactDOM.render(JSX, document.getElementById("challenge-node"));
//The text inside the getElementById must go between quotes just as string is written.

//Not really sure what the DOM is. This needs some extra investigation on my part.

/**
 * So far, you've learned that JSX is a convenient tool to write 
 * readable HTML within JavaScript. With React, we can render 
 * this JSX directly to the HTML DOM using React's rendering API 
 * known as ReactDOM.
 * 
 * ReactDOM offers a simple method to render React elements to 
 * the DOM which looks like this: ReactDOM.render
 * (componentToRender, targetNode), where the first argument is 
 * the React element or component that you want to render, and 
 * the second argument is the DOM node that you want to render 
 * the component to.
 * 
 * As you would expect, ReactDOM.render() must be called after 
 * the JSX element declarations, just like how you must declare 
 * variables before using them.
