// write your code here
const JSX=
<div>
    <h1>Hey there!</h1>

    <p>This here is my first attempt at writing in react. It does not look well, at least to me, since the code editor uses color similar to the one I normally use when programming, and this should be plain text!</p>
    <ul>
    <li>First Item</li>
    <li>Second Item</li>
    <li>Third Item</li>
    </ul>
</div>;

/**
 * The last challenge was a simple example of JSX, but JSX can 
 * represent more complex HTML as well.
 * 
 * One important thing to know about nested JSX is that it must 
 * return a single element.
 * 
 * This one parent element would wrap all of the other levels of 
 * nested elements.
 * 
 * For instance, several JSX elements written as siblings with no 
 * parent wrapper element will not transpile.
 * 
 * Here's an example:
 * 
 * Valid JSX:
 * 
 * <div>
 *   <p>Paragraph One</p>
 *   <p>Paragraph Two</p>
 *   <p>Paragraph Three</p>
 * </div>
 * 
 * Invalid JSX:
 * 
 * <p>Paragraph One</p>
 * <p>Paragraph Two</p>
 * <p>Paragraph Three</p>
 * 
 * Define a new constant JSX that renders a div which contains 
 * the following elements in order:
 * 
 * An h1, a p, and an unordered list that contains three li 
 * items. You can include any text you want within each element.
 * 
 * Note: When rendering multiple elements like this, you can wrap 
 * them all in parentheses, but it's not strictly required. Also 
 * notice this challenge uses a div tag to wrap all the child 
 * elements within a single parent element. If you remove the div,
 * the JSX will no longer transpile. Keep this in mind, since it 
 * will also apply when you return JSX elements in React 
 * components.
