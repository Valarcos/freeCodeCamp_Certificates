/**
 * JSX is a syntax that gets compiled into 
 * valid JavaScript. Sometimes, for 
 * readability, you might need to add comments 
 * to your code. Like most programming 
 * languages, JSX has its own way to do this.
 * 
 * To put comments inside JSX, you use the 
 * syntax {/* *,/} to wrap around the comment 
 * text.
